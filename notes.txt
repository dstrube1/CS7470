Krumm:
A user or device context is difficult to model because it has many dimensions, such as location, the identity of devices close by, who else is present, the time, and environmental factors such as sound, motion, temperature, orientation, and other physical variables, many of which can be measured through on-platform sensors

the cache principle: files that had been used at a location in the past were likely to be useful again

typo on pg 287:
while helping distill why certain design decisions where made for each system

ideas:
floor sensors at elevator (don't share until patented)
bluetooth audio transmitters for hiking
ubicomp at grocery / mall
car service like dominos indicating how far along in service process
courthouse
3d map for navigating parking deck or mall
glove for controlling devices (lights, garage door, tv) in a room
	non-dominant hand so as to not accidentally activate
	few gestures (thumb, index, thumb+index) to select
	one gesture to activate / confirm (all fingers out, then fist)
	room-dependent behavior
	programmable - assign behavior to gesture
location aware headphones for museum tours

Cyberguide from Georgia Tech used NCR Wavelan radios compatible with the 802.11b standard (new at that time), and took advantage of the characteristic poor radio propagation to create servers that covered a region called a cell

Weiser 1991:
other names for UbiComp:
compiling
tacit dimension
visual invariants
the horizon
ready-to-hand
the periphery
embodied virtuality

two issues of crucial importance: location and scale
a device can change its behavior based on where it is (eg, what room)

UbiComp technology requires:
1- cheap low power computer with convenient displays
2- software / OS
3- networking

Abowd2000:
three interaction themes: 
	natural interfaces, context-aware applications, and automated capture and access
research areas for error handling of recognition-based interfaces:
	Error reduction
	Error discovery:
		3 techniques: 
			thresholding of confidence measures
			historical statistics
			explicit rule specification
	Reusable infrastructure for error correction
five Ws of context:
	Who: user and surrounding people
	What: what the user is doing
	Where
	When: date, time, and short or long history; changes in times spent at a sequence of locations; changes in a pattern of behavior
	Why: why someone does what they're doing- body temperature, heart rate, and galvanic skin response,

GoFitts.jar how to:

latitude: parallel, degrees N or S
longitude: meridian, degrees E or W
geocoder: translates address or zip to coordinate
reverse geocoder: translates coordinate to address or zip 
location: absolute (lat & lon), relative (eg 100 meters north of an address), or symbolic (place name, eg the mall)
6 techniques for determining the location: 
	1- proximity
	2- trilateration
	3- hyperbolic lateration
	4- triangulation
	5- fingerprinting
	6- dead reckoning

when creating new Android project, very annoying problems kept popping up:

1- could not create parent directory for lock file 
/~/.gradle/wrapper/dists/gradle-8.0-bin/ca5e32bp14vu59qr306oxotwh/gradle-8.0-bin.zip.lck 

Solution: In Android Studio-> Preferences-> Build, Execution, Deployment-> Build Tools-> Gradle, change "Use Gradle from:" from "'gradle-wrapper.properties' file"  to Specified location; use location from `brew update gradle` or `brew upgrade gradle`: /usr/local/Cellar/gradle/8.1.1/libexec

2- In Build view, got this unhelpful error: "Could not find file"
No mention of what file or where it was looking -_-

Solution: in the same path as above (Android Studio-> Preferences-> Build, Execution, Deployment-> Build Tools-> Gradle), in Gradle user home, replace `~/.gradle` with the full path, e.g., /Users/dstrube/.gradle

3- Some new project templates (e.g., Empty View Activity) will give you the option to select the language before beginning creation of the project; others (e.g., Empty Activity) do not and default to Kotlin (less familiar and popular)
]

TODO: splash screen - https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/launch/splash-screen
options: single player / multiplayer
multiplayer: Coming soon
single player: Choose shape: Square, Triangle, Circle, Make your own, Random
Make your own: Coming soon
Square, Triangle, Circle, Random-> Show map, show drawing of guidelines, show done: Great job!
Share with other players?: Coming soon
Share with social media: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube: Coming soon

interesting code:
audiblecards.controller - MainActivity
currentweather.controller - MainActivity
===

Challenges:
Google Maps doesn't make it easy to draw a path on a map
Internet connectivity may be required by the app but unreliable
Finding participants, time, and places to conduct our user study​

Examples of Android Studio bugginess:
1- When creating a new project, some templates give you a choice of language, some do not
2- Gradle path "~/.gradle" not recognized, must type it out
3- Java version not accepted, and unhelpful error "Could not locate file" doesn't tell you what file it's looking for or where it looked
